The issue of handling ever increasing number of transactions on the blockchain puts constantly increasing pressure on each node in the network. The HEAT technology removes this pitfall by intelligently combining the best features of the existing 2.0 cryptos with a completely remade,  sliced binary blockchain mechanism. Using custom built storage and access solution, based on Memory Mapped Files, data stored on disk can be accessed in random sequence and at near RAM memory speeds - without the need to load this data in RAM. Splitting blockchain into separate files for homogenous data types such as unconfirmed and confirmed balances, unconfirmed and confirmed asset buy and sell orders etc. the HEAT JVM is capable of achieving an unbelievable <b>30 million updates</b> per second on commonly available 16-core server. </p></div>
